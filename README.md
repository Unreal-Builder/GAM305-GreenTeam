Project Log Assignments

Module Two Team Project Plan.

Project BioSynth: Team Development Plan

Scenario Overview

•	Title: BioSynth: Inner War

•	Setting: You are a highly advanced nanobot inserted into a futuristic synthetic organism inside a cyborg-human hybrid.

•	Goal: Disable 20 rogue nanoviruses threatening to overtake the biomechanical host from within.

•	Theme: Cyber-biological — featuring glowing wire networks, semi-organic mechanical corridors, red muscle fibers fused with circuit boards, and a digital/organic atmosphere.

Key Game Elements

•	Magnetic Lifts: Horizontal and vertical hover elevators for navigating biomechanical corridors.

•	EMP Bomb Pickups: Collectible devices that temporarily disable virus shields.

•	Virus Behavior: Rogue nanoviruses replicate via data corruption, not cellular splitting.

•	Triangulation HUD: Signal-tracking HUD showing virus locations by visual pings and signal strength.

•	Futuristic Weapon Pickups

________________________________________
Task Management & Tracking

•	GitHub:

o	Repository for code, documentation, and version control

o	Design Document and Traceability Matrix collaboratively maintained

•	Microsoft Excel:

o	Used for Traceability Matrix and Test Plan

o	Shared via GitHub or OneDrive for real-time collaboration

o	Traceability Matrix Tracks:

	Task name, description, assignee, due date, status, notes

o	Test Plan Tracks:

	Features, test steps, expected and actual results, pass/fail, tester info

•	Microsoft Word:

o	Design documentation, planning notes, and final deliverables stored in GitHub
