Project Log Assignments

Module Three Project Log – Team Development: QA and Testing Plan

Project Title: BioSynth: Inner War

As a development team, we have created the following plan for quality assurance and testing throughout our project timeline.

Preferred Communication and Collaboration Methods

Our team will be using Discord as the primary communication platform. We will hold regular check-ins two to three times per week, depending on availability, using designated channels for general discussion, bug reports, task updates, and asset sharing.

For collaborative documentation, we are using a shared Excel file to maintain our test plan and traceability matrix. This Excel document will be updated continuously throughout development and added to version control once final testing and submissions are complete.

QA Testing Plan and Schedule

We have established a structured testing process during our development cycle:

Play Testing will begin during early development (Week 3–4) and focus on validating core systems such as player movement, item pickups, and HUD functionality.

Demo Testing will occur around Week 5–6, before any public-facing or marketing demos. This stage will test overall gameplay balance, usability, and system stability.

Code Release Testing will happen in Week 7 and include a full review of all game systems, ensuring that the final build is functioning correctly and free of major issues.

What Will Be Tested

We will conduct QA on a range of game elements, including:

Core gameplay systems: player movement, magnetic lift, EMP bomb usage, AI behavior, and triangulation HUD signals.

Interactions: item pickups, weapon systems, virus detection and replication, and win/loss conditions.

Environment: navigation, lighting, sound, and potential issues with collision or level design.

UI/UX elements: HUD feedback, menu navigation, signal displays, and visual/audio responses for actions.

Each item will be marked with a simple pass or fail status during testing. We will also note any related issues in our bug tracking system.

Updating the Test Plan

The test plan is a living document and will be updated regularly as new features are added or changes are made to the design. Any changes to game mechanics, UI, or levels will prompt a review and adjustment of related test cases. This ensures that QA stays aligned with development progress.

After final testing is complete and the project is ready for submission, we will add the test plan and traceability matrix to our GitHub repository under version control.

Bug Reporting and Tracking

All bugs will be reported in the team’s Discord channel designated for bug reports. Each report will include:

A short description of the issue

Reproduction steps

The expected and actual outcomes

The date it was discovered

The tester’s name

Bugs will also be logged in our shared Excel document. This document includes details such as the bug ID, description, status (open, in progress, fixed), who it’s assigned to, and when it was fixed. A separate section of the file tracks changes over time so we can maintain a clear history of what was updated and when.

This QA plan will help ensure the final game is functional, engaging, and stable. Once the final round of testing is complete, all QA documentation will be formally added to version control and submitted with the project.

Module Two Team Project Plan.

Project BioSynth: Team Development Plan

Scenario Overview

•	Title: BioSynth: Inner War

•	Setting: You are a highly advanced nanobot inserted into a futuristic synthetic organism inside a cyborg-human hybrid.

•	Goal: Disable 20 rogue nanoviruses threatening to overtake the biomechanical host from within.

•	Theme: Cyber-biological — featuring glowing wire networks, semi-organic mechanical corridors, red muscle fibers fused with circuit boards, and a digital/organic atmosphere.

Key Game Elements

•	Magnetic Lifts: Horizontal and vertical hover elevators for navigating biomechanical corridors.

•	EMP Bomb Pickups: Collectible devices that temporarily disable virus shields.

•	Virus Behavior: Rogue nanoviruses replicate via data corruption, not cellular splitting.

•	Triangulation HUD: Signal-tracking HUD showing virus locations by visual pings and signal strength.

•	Futuristic Weapon Pickups
